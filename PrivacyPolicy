Privacy Policy
Last updated: July 5, 2025
This privacy policy governs the use of the Mi Recetario application for Android devices, developed by Azael Martínez.
What information do we collect?
This app does not collect personal information such as name, age, email, precise location, etc.
Information storage
All information (recipes, notes, searches, etc.) is stored locally on the user's device using an internal database.
All data is saved only on the user’s device.
Neither the developer nor third parties have access to this data.
No data is transmitted to external servers or synced to the cloud.
The content created or edited by the user remains on the device unless the user chooses to share it manually.
Sharing function
• The user can export and share recipes in .pdf or .txt format through external apps like WhatsApp or others.
• This function is completely manual and optional, and the app does not automatically send any data.
• The shared file contains no personal data, only the content the user has chosen to export.
Recipe reading and language detection
• The app includes a text-to-speech function to help users listen to recipes.
• It can also automatically detect the language of the text to read it properly.
• These features run locally on the device and do not send data to external servers.
Internal search
• The app includes a local search feature that allows the user to find recipes by name or ingredients.
• This search works offline and does not collect user information.
Use of third-party services
The app uses Google AdMob to display ads. This service may collect limited data such as:
• Approximate location (based on network)
• Device type
• Interactions with ads
This data is collected and managed directly by Google and its partners.
Cookies and advertising
Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to show ads based on the user’s previous visits to this or other apps or websites.
